  Welcome ! My name is Christian and I am a huge tech "geek" sports "fanatic" and car "enthusiast". 
  I have a passion for helping others when and where I can . My goal in life is to leave this world a little better then
  it was when I first entered it. I want my name to be spoken of with nothing but positivity even when I am not around. 
  Spreading positivity and good vibes with everyone I come into contact with is how I roll so I hope I can bring some of that
  to you and anyone who comes across my portfolio! My projects all aim to make life just a little easier . From searching 
  stats on your favorite sports figures to creating top notch websites for car enthusiasts to enjoy .
